# DocumentAI
## **Overview**
AmedAI is a Python-based document processing and chatbot system that utilizes LangChain for text processing and OpenAI embeddings for similarity search. It integrates with Pinecone to store and query vectorized document chunks efficiently.

---
## **Features**
- Load PDF documents from local storage or online sources
- Convert PDFs to text for processing
- Chunk text into smaller segments (~200 words per chunk)
- Convert text chunks into embeddings using OpenAI
- Store embeddings in a Pinecone vector database
- Perform similarity search to retrieve relevant document sections
- Query a chatbot with context-aware responses based on document data

---
# Usage
## 1. Load Data
- The system provides two methods for loading PDFs:
  - uploaderOnline(link): Uses OnlinePDFLoader from LangChain to load documents from a URL
  - uploaderLocal(path): Uses UnstructuredPDFLoader from LangChain to load documents from a local file
- After loading, the PDF is converted into a text document

## 2. Process Data
- Text is split into chunks (~200 words each)
- The openAIEmbeddings() function converts each chunk into a numerical vector representation

## 3. Store Data in Pinecone
- A Pinecone index is initialized with a dimension of 1536, optimized for OpenAI’s embeddings
- The generated embeddings are uploaded to the Pinecone cloud database

## 4. Interact with the Chatbot
- When running main.py, the program provides a CLI menu with options to:
  - Upload more documents
  - Query the chatbot
  - Querying the chatbot:
- The input question is vectorized using OpenAI embeddings
- A similarity search is performed in Pinecone using cosine similarity
- The three most relevant chunks are retrieved and used as context in an OpenAI API request
- The chatbot responds based on the retrieved document information
- If no relevant data is found, the chatbot notifies the user

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Database**: Pinecone (Vector Database)
- **Libraries**:
  - `langchain` – Text processing and embeddings
  - `openai` – Embeddings and chatbot integration
  - `pinecone` – Vector database storage and querying
  - `unstructured` – PDF parsing and text extraction

---
## **Setup**

### **1. Dependencies**
Ensure Python is installed along with the required libraries. Install missing packages using:
```
pip install {Package}
```

### **2. API Key Configuration**
You will need to configure your API Key for both OpenAI and Pinecone in both files:
```
OpenAiKey = "key123"
PineconeKey = "key234"
```

### **3. Running the Code**
Run the code by entering this into terminal:
```
python main.py
```
